# SmartEverything Microchip RN4870 BLE 4.2
---
This is a library for the RN4870 a BLE 4.2 developed by Microchip 

Microchips RN4870/71 Bluetooth Low Energy Module is a fully certified Bluetooth
Smart module offering Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity in compact form factor. 

With all of its advanced features, it allows the Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity to be included in
designs with minimal engineering.

The RN4870/71 provides the control interface based on ASCII commands sent over UART. 

The ASCII command interface on the RN4870/71 is very similar to that of RN41/42/52/4020/4677, 
providing an easy migration path for customers currently using the RN modules.

Interactive ASCII commands enable the RN4870/71 to be configured without complex configuration tools. 
The RN4870/71 supports both peripheral and central Generic Access Profile (GAP) roles, 
actively scanning for other connectable devices instead of waiting for incoming 
connection requests.
